# strrr-html

A tiny prototype for a strrr.tv website.

- Run `make` to pull the latest data rom the Strrr API
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies (once)
- Run `npm run build` uses eleventy to build a regular website (this also runs `make`)
- The `main` branch automatically deploys to https://list.strrr.tv
