Together with his partner-in-crime, Boris Blank, Dieter Meier wrote numerous hits for Yello in the 80’s and 90’s — among them “Bostich”, “Vicious Games”, “The Rhythm Divine” and “The Race”. In addition, he is also known for his entrepreneurship and his openness towards all other fields of artistic endeavor. Starting as a performance artist in the fluxus tradition in November 1969, Meier famously counted a proverbial mountain of screws on Zurich’s Heimplatz to package them into bags of 1,000 screws each. Eventually Meier became an experimental filmmaker, a painter, a sculptor, and with Yello, an international pop star. On STRRR TV, Dieter Meier reflects upon his long and illustrious career by showcasing a trailer to his film “The Lightmaker”, his very own video to “Bostitch” and even shares a story with us about how he once met Lady Gaga at a benefit dinner for Bob Wilson in New York.","title":"Dieter Meier","image":"DieterMeierFarbe_7936_LuciaLux_smaller_yeicm6","credits":"Interview by Max Dax, editing by Lucia Lux, DOP Lucia Lux, camera 2 by Elena Panouli, animations by TOPE, introduction by Craig Holiday Haynes.","order":31,"season_number":2,"episode_number":2,"is_published":true},{"id":36,"host":"Britta Thie","description":"Britta Thie is a Berlin-based artist whose work engages emerging technologies and the relationship between self and digital representation.

Sabottka: “Look at Chernobyl and Fukushima: It is incomprehensible how fast people tend to forget that the use of atomic energy ranks among the biggest threats to the human race. In his STRRR episode, Scumeck Sabottka talks about personal video hightlights he has found on the Internet, among them Lou Reed’s last interview, a haunting confrontation between Hunter S. Thompson and a Hell’s Angel and a deeply moving French TV interview with Robbie Williams.","title":"Scumeck Sabottka","image":"SS_9104_SW_fsz90z","credits":"Interview + 2nd Camera: Max Dax, DOP + editing: Lucia Lux, Photo: Lucia Lux, Animations: TOPE, Introduction: Craig Holiday Haynes","order":35,"season_number":5,"episode_number":7,"is_published":true},{"id":70,"host":"Marcel Dettmann","description":"There are very few DJs in the techno scene today who are as influential as Marcel Dettmann. Before becoming Berghain’s first resident DJ soon after the opening of the landmark Berlin techno club in 2004, he was already shaping the minimal sound of Ostgut, Berghain’s legendary predecessor. Born and raised in the former GDR, Marcel Dettmann developed a unique signature sound that could be described as contemporary electro-techno with a strong EBM touch. But Marcel Dettmann is also a go-between in the world of music and art. For STRRR TV host and photographer Friederike von Rauch for instance, he composed a series of tracks that serve as soundscapes to her monastery photographs. In his STRRR episode, Marcel Dettmann revisits formative moments of his childhood in the former GDR when he presents, among other clips, an interview with the East German photographer Harald Hauswald, a documentary film about industrial music and the musical fairy tale „Peter and the Wolf“.","title":"Marcel Dettmann","image":"MarcelDettmann9030SW_ffscv9","credits":"Interview + 2nd Camera: Max Dax, DOP + editing: Lucia Lux, Photo: Lucia Lux, Animations: TOPE, Introduction: Craig Holiday Haynes","order":25,"season_number":4,"episode_number":2,"is_published":true},{"id":95,"host":"Jean-Michel Jarre","description":"With the release of his first two albums, Oxygène and Équinoxe, in the late 1970’s, French electronic music pioneer Jean Michel Jarre proved that synthesizer music could sell millions of records. Jarre was not only the first musician from the field of electronic music who had mainstream success. He also staged record-breaking concerts that attracted audiences by the millions – in Paris, in front of the pyramids of Gizeh, or in China where Jarre was welcomed as the first pop star from the West to perform there. Jean Michel Jarre never stopped producing music for the masses. Especially the last decade saw the composer non-stop bustling: Jarre not only released two albums of collaborations with famous electronic musicians such as Primal Scream’s Bobby Gillespie, Yello’s Dieter Meier and the late Edgar Froese (of Tangerine Dream). He also released Équinox Infinité — the second part of Équinoxe, four decades after the release of the original album.","title":"Jean-Michel Jarre","image":"EEL_1427smaller_smuqjp","credits":"Interview by Max Dax\nShot by Luci Lux and Max Dax\nEdited by Luci Lux\nIntroduction: Craig Holiday Haynes\nAnimations: Tope","order":30,"season_number":6,"episode_number":1,"is_published":true},{"id":102,"host":"Hans-Joachim Roedelius","description":"\nHans Joachim Roedelius is one of Germany’s most prolific auteurs of cosmic music. As early as in 1968 he founded the seminal ambient experimental pop group Kluster/Cluster together with Dieter Moebius and part-time collaborator Conrad Schnitzler that would release countless albums until 2009. In 1973 Roedelius founded Harmonia – a band that would jam with Brian Eno and that David Bowie once famously called „his favorite band from Germany“. To this day, Roedelius is continuously releasing solo albums as well as collaborative works with, amongst others, Lloyd Cole and Arnold Kasar. In his STRRR episode, Roedelius shares with us a number of film scenes and video moments that changed his life, amongst them Charlie Chaplin as Anton Hynkel, Brian Eno and rare concert footage from one of his own concerts.","title":"Hans-Joachim Roedelius","image":"Roedelius_931972alt_c0iggh.jpg","credits":"Interview by Max Dax, shot & edited by Luci Lux, Introduction: Craig Holiday Haynes, Animations: Tope","order":50,"season_number":6,"episode_number":7,"is_published":false}]}
