Encouraged by his mother, a piano teacher, he began composing instrumental music at a young age but didn’t take up songwriting until 2008 while studying music at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. Dare’s elegantly moody, piano-based compositions and haunting voice drew comparisons to artists such as Thom Yorke and James Blake. In 2013, he attracted the attention of Erased Tapes founder Robert Raths, who released his debut album Whelm and its follow-up Aforger in 2014 and 2016 to widespread critical acclaim. In his STRRR episode, Douglas shares with us his affection for Marina Abramovic and Candy Darling in addition to reminding us of Patti Smith’s “Advice to the Young”",

By merging motifs from science-fiction novels and films with elements of Gothic painting in her complex acrylic glass works, she engenders a vast amalgamation of different periods and influences. Flickering in the depths of her layered, three-dimensional glass paintings we can catch glimpses of her penchant for the sacred and banal. This way her paintings, mostly set in baroquely opulent forms, become atmospheric force fields, intensely fictional and sensuous, hovering between beauty and threat, two extremes that Scholz sees as being part of the primeval idea of life itself.",

The audiovisual language can be seen as a true contemporary global vernacular”, says Japanese audio-visual artist Ryoichi Kurokawa. Born in Japan in 1978 and currently based in Berlin, Ryoichi Kurokawa is an internationally acclaimed multimedia artist who experiments in the field of synaesthetics and our perception of time. His utterly beautiful yet complex installations are titled “mol”, “orbit” or “unfold” and bring together highly abstract electronic music, field recordings, computer graphics, animations and light. As a result, his audiovisual installation pieces have been shown to great critical and public acclaim at international festivals and museums including Tate Modern, Venice Biennale, Palais de Tokyo, Transmediale, and Sonar. In his episode for STRRR he showcases and talks about some of his most striking installation pieces and artworks and the process of creating them.",

    "description": "Dieter Meier, one half of the electro pop duo Yello, is one of the most recognized artists to have ever emerged from Switzerland. Together with his partner-in-crime, Boris Blank, Dieter Meier wrote numerous hits for Yello in the 80’s and 90’s — among them “Bostich”, “Vicious Games”, “The Rhythm Divine” and “The Race”. In addition, he is also known for his entrepreneurship and his openness towards all other fields of artistic endeavor. Starting as a performance artist in the fluxus tradition in November 1969, Meier famously counted a proverbial mountain of screws on Zurich’s Heimplatz to package them into bags of 1,000 screws each. Eventually Meier became an experimental filmmaker, a painter, a sculptor, and with Yello, an international pop star. On STRRR TV, Dieter Meier reflects upon his long and illustrious career by showcasing a trailer to his film “The Lightmaker”, his very own video to “Bostitch” and even shares a story with us about how he once met Lady Gaga at a benefit dinner for Bob Wilson in New York.",

Since then, Matias Aguayo has been hard to get a hold of — he travels the world and especially to South America, spontaneously appearing with his boom box at free street gigs or to record new music.\nFor his STRRR episode, Matias Aguayo selected a variety of clips, ranging from newsreel footage of Salvador Allende holding a speech in front of the United Nations to the opening sequence of Chris Marker’s film “La Jetée”.",

    "description": "Sven Marquardt is one of Berlin’s most iconic celebrities. As the doorman of both the legendary techno clubs Ostgut and Berghain, Marquardt is probably Berlin’s most notorious gate keeper of all time. Although less known to the public, he is also a prolific photographer. From 1982 until the Fall of the Wall in 1989, Marquardt became a chronicler of the intense subculture of the German Democratic Republic in East Berlin. After the reunification of Germany in 1990 he ceased working as a photographer for nearly 13 years, only to reignite his career fervently in 2003. Since then his black-and-white photographs showcasing scenes of lust, violence and passion have been exhibited in galleries and museums throughout Europe. \nIn his STRRR episode, Sven Marquardt talks about his biggest influence, the German film director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, as well as Madonna, Radiohead and Iggy Pop’s 1977 smash hit “Night Clubbing”.",

Her work consists of installations, video, sculpture, and print with soundtracks made in collaboration with musicians such as GAMEFACE and DJ Cavia.  Imagery and themes are drawn from technology, religion, pop culture, neuroscience and anatomy, with dizzying use of color, dimension, and movement. Her pieces stimulate a visceral  response akin to virtual reality or gaming, inviting multiple viewings to grasp the depth of exploration. Lu abstains from assigning political or nationalistic meaning to her work, finding it confining and alienating. Instead, she pursues universal truths.  Lu’s work has been exhibited at the Venice Biennale, the Centre Pompidou in Paris, Societe in Berlin and she was announced as the eighth BMW Art Journey winner during Art Basel in 2019.",

From 1990-2007 he ran the techno label Masterminded For Success (MFS). In 2007 Reeder returned to music production and high profile remixing - among his client-friends were Depeche Mode, Pet Shop Boys, Yello, and New Order. 2015 saw the release of the highly acclaimed film 'B-Movie ‘, a biopic depicting Reeder's life in 80s West-Berlin – a major hit at the Berlinale of that year that catapulted Mark Reeder into movie fame. In his STRRR episode Marke Reeder talks about the vanished city of West Berlin, about the Pet Shop Boys scoring Eisenstein’s “Battleship Potemkin” film and New Order.",

Her singing style is unique as she mixes jazz, blues and soul to a distinctive new amalgamate. Born in Charleroi, Belgium in 1978, de Biasio studied classical dance and flute before discovering her voice and her love of singing. Heralded by the British BBC DJ Gilles Peterson ever since the day she released her debut album „A Stomach Is Burning“ in 2007, de Biasio has since released three albums and an outstanding 24-minute EP with the title “Blackened City” that was inspired by her travels through post-industrial environments such as Charleroi, Manchester or Detroit. With the latter piece, de Biasio stunningly charted new territory in jazz by adding noir-ish, soul, avant pop and classical elements to the formula. In her STRRR episode she shares with us footage of Orson Welles having breakfast with French film journalists, a mind-blowing interview sequence with Mark Hollis of Talk Talk fame, and a surprising trailer for the new Alien movie with Melanie de Biasio’s music - and more.",

Before becoming Berghain’s first resident DJ soon after the opening of the landmark Berlin techno club in 2004, he was already shaping the minimal sound of Ostgut, Berghain’s legendary predecessor. Born and raised in the former GDR, Marcel Dettmann developed a unique signature sound that could be described as contemporary electro-techno with a strong EBM touch. But Marcel Dettmann is also a go-between in the world of music and art. For STRRR TV host and photographer Friederike von Rauch for instance, he composed a series of tracks that serve as soundscapes to her monastery photographs. In his STRRR episode, Marcel Dettmann revisits formative moments of his childhood in the former GDR when he presents, among other clips, an interview with the East German photographer Harald Hauswald, a documentary film about industrial music and the musical fairy tale „Peter and the Wolf“.",
